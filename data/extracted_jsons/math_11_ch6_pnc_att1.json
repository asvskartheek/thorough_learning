    "chapter_name": "Permutations and Combinations",
    "chapter_text": "The chapter opens with an introduction that motivates the need for counting techniques by considering practical problems – for example, a suitcase with a number lock where one must determine the number of possible arrangements without listing them all. It then introduces the fundamental principle of counting (or multiplication principle), which states that if one event can occur in m ways and a subsequent event in n ways, then the two events can occur in m × n ways. The text explains this principle using everyday scenarios such as selecting a pant and a shirt or choosing a school bag, tiffin box, and water bottle in succession.\n\nNext, the chapter defines permutations as arrangements in a definite order and shows that the number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by the product n × (n – 1) × (n – 2) ... (n – r + 1), a result which is more compactly expressed using factorial notation (n!). The concept and properties of factorials are explained and examples are provided to illustrate how to compute values like 5! and 7! as well as differences such as 7! – 5!.\n\nA derivation of the formula for nP₍ᵣ₎ is then presented, including its generalization to cases where objects are not all distinct – that is, when some objects repeat. The text details how to adjust the count by dividing by the factorial of the number of repetitions, and states general theorems for such cases.\n\nThe chapter then moves on to combinations, where order is not important. It explains that the number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is given by nC₍ᵣ₎ = n!/(r!(n – r)!) and discusses the relationship between permutations and combinations. A summary of the key formulas – including those for the multiplication principle, permutations (with and without repetition), and combinations – is provided at the end of the chapter. Finally, a historical note outlines the origins and development of these ideas from ancient Indian mathematics through contributions from various cultures.",
