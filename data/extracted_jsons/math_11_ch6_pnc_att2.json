  "chapter_text": "6.1  Introduction\n\nSuppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a particular sequence with no repetition. Somehow, you have forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact, these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques.\n\n6.2  Fundamental Principle of Counting\n\nLet us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many different pairs of a pant and a shirt can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore, there are 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.\n\nLet us name the three pants as P1, P2, P3 and the two shirts as S1, S2. Then, these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1.\n\nLet us consider another problem of the same type. Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes and 2 water bottles. In how many ways can she carry these items (choosing one each)? A school bag can be chosen in 2 different ways. After a school bag is chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3 different ways. Hence, there are 2 × 3 = 6 pairs of school bag and a tiffin box. For each of these pairs a water bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. Hence, there are 6 × 2 = 12 different ways in which Sabnam can carry these items to school. If we name the 2 school bags as B1, B2, the three tiffin boxes as T1, T2, T3 and the two water bottles as W1, W2, these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2.\n\nIn fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication principle, which states that “If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is m×n.”\n\nThe above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows: ‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can occur in n different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is m × n × p.’\n\nIn the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: (i) the event of choosing a pant, (ii) the event of choosing a shirt. In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: (i) the event of choosing a school bag, (ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box, (iii) the event of choosing a water bottle. Here, in both cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of different ways of the occurrence of the events in this chosen order.\n\n6.3 Permutations\n\nIn Example 1 of the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, etc. Here, each arrangement is different from the other; in other words, the order of writing the letters is important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements such as NUM, NMU, MUN, NUB, etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words = 6 × 5 × 4 = 120 (by using the multiplication principle). If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would be 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.\n\nDefinition 1: A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of objects taken some or all at a time.\n\n6.3.1 Permutations when all the objects are distinct\n\nTheorem 1: The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time, where 0 < r ≤ n and the objects do not repeat, is n × (n – 1) × (n – 2) ... (n – r + 1), which is denoted by nPr.\n\nProof: There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in r vacant places by the n objects. The first place can be filled in n ways; following which, the second place can be filled in (n – 1) ways; following which, the third place can be filled in (n – 2) ways; …, the rth place can be filled in (n – (r – 1)) ways. Therefore, the number of ways of filling in r vacant places in succession is n(n – 1)(n – 2)...(n – r + 1).\n\n6.3.2 Factorial Notation\n\nThe notation n! represents the product of the first n natural numbers, i.e., 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × (n – 1) × n, and is denoted as n!. We read this symbol as ‘n factorial’. For example, 1 = 1!, 1 × 2 = 2!, 1 × 2 × 3 = 3!, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 4!, and so on. We define 0! = 1. We can write 5! = 5 × 4! = 5 × 4 × 3! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Clearly, for a natural number n, n! = n × (n – 1)! = n (n – 1)(n – 2)! [provided n ≥ 2] = n (n – 1)(n – 2)(n – 3)! [provided n ≥ 3], and so on.\n\n6.3.3 Derivation of the Formula for nPr\n\nMultiplying the product n(n – 1)...(n – r + 1) by (n – r)! in both the numerator and the denominator, we obtain n!/(n – r)!. Thus, nPr = n!/(n – r)!, where 0 ≤ r ≤ n. In particular, when r = n, nPn = n!/0! = n!. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving behind all the objects, and there is only one way of doing so. Thus, nP0 = 1.\n\n6.3.4 Permutations when the Objects are not Distinct\n\nSuppose we have to find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ROOT. In this case, the letters are not all different as there are 2 Os. Temporarily treating the Os as distinct, the number of permutations is 4!. However, since the Os are identical, we must divide by 2! to correct for overcounting. Therefore, the number of distinct permutations is 4!/2!.\n\nSimilarly, for the word INSTITUTE, which has 9 letters with I appearing 2 times and T appearing 3 times, the number of distinct permutations is 9!/(2!×3!).\n\nTheorem 3: The number of permutations of n objects, where p objects are of the same kind and the rest are all different, is n!/p!.\n\nTheorem 4: The number of permutations of n objects, where p1 objects are of one kind, p2 of another kind, ..., pk of the kth kind, is n!/(p1! p2! ... pk!).\n\n6.4 Combinations\n\nConsider a group of 3 lawn tennis players X, Y, Z. A team consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can this be done? Since the order is not important, there are only 3 possible teams: XY, YZ, and ZX. Each selection is called a combination of 3 objects taken 2 at a time.\n\nFor example, if we have 4 objects A, B, C, D and we take 2 at a time, the possible combinations are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD, which is 4C2 = 6. Corresponding to each combination, there are 2! arrangements; hence, 4P2 = 4C2 × 2!.\n\nSimilarly, for 5 objects taken 3 at a time, 5P3 = 5C3 × 3!.\n\nThis leads to the general relationship: nPr = nCr × r!.\n\nRemarks:\n1. nCr = n!/(r!(n – r)!) and nCr = nC(n – r).\n2. We define nC0 = 1.\n3. Selecting nothing at all is considered to be 1 way.\n\nSummary\n\n– Fundamental principle of counting: If an event can occur in m ways and a subsequent event can occur in n ways, then the total number of occurrences is m × n.\n– The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time (without repetition) is nPr = n!/(n – r)!.\n– Factorial notation: n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n, with 0! defined as 1.\n– The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time (with repetition allowed) is n^r.\n– For objects with repetitions, the number of distinct permutations is given by dividing n! by the factorials of the number of repetitions.\n– The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is nCr = n!/(r!(n – r)!).\n\nHistorical Note\n\nThe concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to ancient times, with significant contributions from Indian mathematicians such as Mahavira and Bhaskaracharya. The systematic study of these topics was further developed in works such as Ars Conjectandi by Jacob Bernoulli, laying the foundations for modern combinatorics.",
